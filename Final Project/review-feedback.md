   - Q1a: 
     - comments: more attention could have been paid
     - marks: 2 + 10 + 8 = 20
   - Q2: 
     - comments: Promising work but prompt, code and data were expected to replicated/ verify work. So
     marks deducted for it.
     - marks: 10 + 0 + (10 + 10 + 10 + 10) + 10
   - Total: 20 + 60 = 80
     (Out of 120, will be scaled later)
